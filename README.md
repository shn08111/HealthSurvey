# HealthSurvey

## Brief Description of this Project

This project is a simple survey form that records my daily health status i.e. food/water intake, exercise duration, and sleep duration. 

HTML and CSS were used in creating the form, and VSCode was used as the code editor for this project.

## Motivation behind this Project

During the past two years of the COVID pandemic, I stopped going outdoors and exercising due to lack motivation and energy, causing my body to fall out of shape. Moreover, I've eaten so much fast food and desserts that I gained a lot weight. Recently, I realized that I should start taking care of my physical wellness once again. However, I still lack motivation to live a healthy life. I thought that a good way to begin would be to record the meals and the laziness of my unhealthy lifestyle at the end of every day. In this way, hopefully I would realize the urgency of my situation and start working out and eating healthily.


## Aim of this Project

My ultimate goal for doing this project was to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Recently, my interest in Web Design has grown, and I wanted to explore the work behind website creation.


## Personal Thoughts on this Project

Although I faced many challenges while working on this project as a complete newbie in the field of Web Design, it was a very worthwhile and fulfilling experience. It was indeed fascinating to see how the aesthetics of the form developed as I added more codes in the css file. 

I think I actually enjoyed working on this project! :)

I will continue working on more advanced projects to explore more about Web Design, likely facing many challenges and hopefully joy on the way.


## Future Improvements

Even though I am proud of my very first project, I must admit that this form lacks a lot in terms of the quality as a website.

Ideally, the information submitted on the form should be saved on a different website, on which the forms are organized by date. More features would include search, trend visualization, and calorie count based on database of known foods. Hopefully in the future, I would be able to implement such features as I learn more about Web Design.
